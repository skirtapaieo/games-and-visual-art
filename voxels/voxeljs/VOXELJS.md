# Voxel.js

## Why should I care about Voxel.js?

Voxel.js provides a simple way to create voxel-based (think Minecraft-like) games or simulations in the browser. It's particularly useful if you're interested in this specific type of 3D graphics.

## What is the context of Voxel.js?

Voxel.js is designed for creating voxel-based games or interactive simulations, usually running in the web browser.

## What is Voxel.js?

Voxel.js is an open-source JavaScript library focused on creating voxel-based environments. It allows you to build, modify, and texture 3D blocks in a 3D world.

## Why was Voxel.js conceived?

Voxel.js was created to make it easier for developers to create voxel-based games without having to build everything from scratch.

## Who came up with Voxel.js?

Voxel.js is a community-driven project, initially created by developers interested in voxel-based game development.

## What are some great Voxel.js examples?

- Browser-based Minecraft clones.
- Educational programs teaching basic programming through voxel-based environments.
- Simple games with block-building mechanics.

## What are the things that people say Voxel.js needs to improve?

- Documentation: Could be more comprehensive.
- Community Support: Not as extensive as other 3D libraries.

## What are the main alternatives to Voxel.js?

- Custom-built voxel engines.
- Unity or Unreal Engine with voxel-based plugins.
- Engines specifically designed for voxel-based games, like MagicaVoxel.

## Overview of the Voxel.js stack

- Core Engine: Handles basic voxel rendering and user interaction.
- Plugins: Extensible through various plugins that add functionality.
- Scripting: Customizable through JavaScript for advanced features.
