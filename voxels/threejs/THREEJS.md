# Three.js

## Why should I care about Three.js?

Three.js allows you to create 3D graphics in the browser without having to deal with the complexities of WebGL. It offers a high-level API for creating animations, visualizations, games, and other interactive 3D applications, making it easier for developers to add an extra dimension to web projects.

## What is the context of Three.js?

Three.js operates in the context of web development, particularly frontend development. It leverages WebGL for rendering 3D graphics, but provides a more user-friendly API that is more accessible to developers who may not be experts in 3D graphics programming.

## What is Three.js?

Three.js is a JavaScript library that provides a simple yet robust framework for creating 3D graphics in web browsers. It offers a wide range of features, from basic shapes and materials to complex scenes with lighting, shadows, and texture mapping.

## Why was Three.js conceived?

Three.js was conceived to simplify 3D graphics programming for the web. WebGL, although powerful, has a steep learning curve and can be daunting to work with directly. Three.js abstracts much of this complexity, allowing developers to focus on the creative aspects of their projects.

## Who came up with Three.js?

Three.js was created by Ricardo Cabello, also known as "Mr.doob," and it's maintained by him along with a community of contributors.

## What are some great Three.js examples?

- A-Frame: A framework for creating virtual reality experiences.
- 3D Product Configurators: For customizing products in real-time.
- Interactive Data Visualizations: Representing complex data in a 3D space.

## What are the things that people say Three.js needs to improve?

- Documentation: While extensive, could be more beginner-friendly.
- Performance: Heavy scenes can be taxing on less powerful hardware.
- Mobile Support: Varies and sometimes is not as reliable as desktop support.

## What are the main alternatives to Three.js?

- Babylon.js: Another high-level 3D graphics library.
- Direct WebGL: For those who need complete control, albeit at the cost of complexity.
- Unity WebGL: Exporting 3D scenes from Unity to WebGL.

## Overview of the Three.js stack

- Core: Basic geometries, cameras, and materials.
- Extras: Additional features like loaders, controls, and post-processing effects.
- Renderer: WebGL-based renderer, with fallbacks for older systems.
- Scene graph: Object3D, Mesh, Group, and more for managing 3D objects.

This should give you a well-rounded understanding of what Three.js is, why it's useful, and what it brings to the table in terms of 3D web graphics.
