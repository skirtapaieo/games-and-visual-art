# About

This repo is almost random code ..

- Birds flying around on a Karl Larsson background - originally made in Java, in 1997, as an applet, partially recreated in Three.js
- Atari 600 XL - lo-fi demo of animating letters - originally made in Assembler, recreated using JavaScript
- Inventory-system - My first inventory program for my parents store - we came up with the idea to create article numbers with 1000's as spring season 1993 and so on - the program listed part of itself and then during inventory they entered the inventory of an article as a REM statement and then learned how to save and store on tape - so the program actually contained the inventory data as REM statements :-)
- Kuramoto - attempt to test Kuramoto model oscillations = a strong foundation helps synchronize things, using Matplotlib - metronomes explain it best: https://twitter.com/wonderofscience/status/1338823624518754304
- Laufey - an equalizer etc using mp3 of the artist Laufey that my daughter like, using P5 sound library
- OldSchool - my first computers, Intellivision ECS, Atari 600 (XL), ABC-80 (only in School)
- P5 experiments - i borrowed things from Hikadan (can't find you!) to test to move between various demo screens - for more about: P5js.org or something cool: https://p5-demos.glitch.me/
- Sinecube - waves and geometry, initially done in Assembler (https://archive.org/details/Atari_ST-3D_Graphics_Programming/page/n3/mode/2up), now you use JavaScript/P5, computers a billion times better
- Snake - used ChatGPT that stole it from the Internets, and when I asked it denied :-)
- Solarsystem - seven iterations on a solarsystem :-)
